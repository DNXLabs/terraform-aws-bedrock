## Overview

AWS Bedrock is a fully managed generative AI service that simplifies building and scaling AI applications by providing access to leading foundation models (FMs) through a unified API endpoint. This Terraform module facilitates the deployment and management of AWS Bedrock resources with enterprise-grade security and flexibility.

## Key Features

### Multi-Model Architecture
- Access to cutting-edge models like Amazon Titan, Anthropic's Claude, and AI21 Labs' Jurassic-2
- Enables comparative model testing without vendor lock-in
- Supports specialized model selection for specific tasks

### Agents for Complex Workflow Automation
- Connect to internal APIs and Lambda functions
- Auto-generate API call sequences for user requests
- Maintain session context for conversational interactions

### Advanced Data Processing
- Multimodal data processing (PDFs, images, audio/video)
- Automated data extraction with customizable output templates
- Confidence scoring to reduce hallucinations

### Enterprise-Grade Security
- AWS IAM integration for granular access control
- Private model customization with dedicated compute
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC standards

## Requirements

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| Terraform | >= 0.13.0 |
| AWS Provider | Latest Recommended Version |

## Usage Example

```hcl
module "aws_bedrock" {
  source = "DNXLabs/bedrock/aws"
  
  # Configure your Bedrock resources here
  # Example configurations will be added as the module develops
}
```

## Terraform Integration Strategies

### IAM Configuration
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "bedrock_execution" {
  name = "bedrock-exec-role"
  
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "bedrock.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })
}
```

### Supporting Infrastructure
```hcl
# S3 Bucket for model training data
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "model_data" {
  bucket = "bedrock-training-data-${var.env}"
}

# Lambda function for custom model hooks
resource "aws_lambda_function" "model_validation" {
  filename      = "lambda.zip"
  function_name = "bedrock-model-validator"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "python3.9"
}
```

## Best Practices
1. Use the latest version of the module
2. Implement proper IAM roles and permissions
3. Configure comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Manage model versions across environments
5. Optimize costs with intelligent scaling policies
